# AirplanePlus Extended

 AirplanePlus Extended is an expansion mod for AirplanePlus that contains new parts consistent with the AirplanePlus art style, and incorporates BDA+ integration for use in BDArmory dogfighter competitions such as Runway Project and Fighter Jet Round Table
 
 ## Purpose
 
 This Expansion will contain a slew of parts originally planned for the main AirplanePlus mod in order to keep the main mod lighter weight for users that do not need or do not want a wide diversity of fighter jet parts or BDA+ dependent content.
 
 ## Plans
 
 ### Current Trajectory
 All current parts that exist in the private beta builds of AirplanePlus will be migrated over to this mod, and any new content will be added to the expansion pack rather than the base mod unless the part is deemed useful enough to be incorporated into the main AirplanePlus. 
 
 
 ### But What About the Main AirplanePlus Mod?
 AirplanePlus will still be worked on and bugfixes will be done to fix any and all remaining issues with the mod, but majorly no new content will be added to the mod as it stands.
