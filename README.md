# Moderately Plane Related

 Moderately Plane Related contains high quality parts consistent with the AirplanePlus art style, and incorporates BDA+ integration for use in BDArmory dogfighter competitions such as Runway Project and Fighter Jet Round Table
 
## Dependencies:
 * Firespitter
 * B9 Part Switch
 
 Will Be moving all remaining parts using Firespitter over to B9 Part Switch, in order to remove Firespitter as a Dependency
 
 ## Purpose
 
 This mod contains a slew of parts originally planned for AirplanePlus in order to keep AirplanePlus lighter weight for users that do not need or do not want a wide diversity of fighter jet parts or BDA+ dependent content. Various new content will be added by the contributors listed below throughout the growth phase of this mod to fit the needs of it's primary use communities.
 
 ## Plans
 
 ### Current Trajectory
 All current parts that exist in the private beta build of AirplanePlus will be migrated over to this mod.
