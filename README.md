 ## Purpose
 
 This mod contains a slew of parts originally intended to be added to AirplanePlus by new management, but has now forked itself into a bigger self sufficient mod that will incorporate BDA+ integration in future parts. Various new content will be added by the contributors throughout the growth phase of this mod to fit the needs of it's primary use communities.
 
 ## Plans
 
 ### Current Trajectory

Most if not all existing content in the mod will likely recieve updates fixing bugs, adjusting meshes, adding IVAs, and improving textures.
